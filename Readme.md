# Basic Typescript Project

## What is typescript ?
Typescript is a super set of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## What is module?
* A file is considered a module in Typescript.
* Modules are executed in their own scope, not in global scope.
* variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly exported using one of the export forms.
